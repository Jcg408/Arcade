Project 3 - Classic Arcade Game Clone
===============================

This project focuses on the use of Object Oriented Javascript and HTML5 to initiate a classic arcade game .
The app.js file was completed using Object Oriented Javascript; The engine.js file resource section has been updated with additional images 
and additional Canvas text code has been added. 

1) Game objective - player must avoid colliding with bugs to reach the golden star and become a princess. Game will reset after a few seconds when goal is reached.

2) Starting the game - Initialize the game by opening the file index.html in your browser. 

3 )Playing the game -  Use keyboard arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right to avoid the enemy bugs as you make your way to the star.
   If you collide with bugs, you are bumped back to the original position. If you reach the star, you will turn into a princess. After a few seconds 
   the game will reset automatically.

 --This is a simplified version of the game. There will be further improvements and additional attributes added at a later time.
